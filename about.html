	In crimes like public harassment, kidnapping etc, people or police find it after the incident happens. Police file a report and start its investigation based on witness(s) and CCTV footage, but even if the culprit is being arrested and lawsuits are filed against him/her, we can not save the victim from going through that trauma or in many cases we can not even save the life of the victim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This software deals with the above mentioned incidents and not only it alarms the nearby concern to reach the spot at once, but also it can save the life of the victim as the police or security personnel reach the spot at the time of the crime, at the same time the person can also call for any ambulance assistance so that the injured can be saved within the critical time frame. Therefore, it will help in reducing and controlling the crime rate in a more effective way and to contribute towards sustainable development of smart surveillance systems. The features that make this software unique are : it does not require any installation, it will be accessible from anywhere and any time, it gives precise and accurate results and it is cross platform software which means it can be accessible from any device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On almost every cross junction in India we have CCTV installed and its footage is being monitored by someone in the monitoring/control room but since it plays more than one or two footage on one system. In many cases, the monitoring person misses out to spot the unwanted incident or the criminal behaviour of a person. Therefore, to overcome these human errors, this software will detect the unwanted behavior of a person or an unwanted situation and trigger an alarm. By alarm we mean it will start indicating that grid which shows the CCTV footage of that place where something criminal or something unusual is taking place. For the situation when more than one incident will happen at the same time, the trigger has the property to start the alarm for a few seconds like 4s and switch to the other side and keep doing this unless the monitoring person confirms his/her attention by turning off the trigger of that grid. The final decision will be on the security or monitoring person to identify if that situation really needs the interference of a police personnel or not. If it needs the interference of a police officer, then he will notify the police to reach the spot at the time of crime and if it does not need the interference of a police, then he will just turn off the alarm trigger/notification. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will use the On streaming data from the CCTV footage in this software. The software will be trained to give more accurate results based on various situations of an unwanted and criminal behaviour of a person like violent gestures, waving of weapons, fighting incidents, accidents of some kind and specifically kidnapping, public harassment incidents and for more sensitive cases.</p>
